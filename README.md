Website
=======

This is my personal website, hosted at https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tniechci/. This uses a [Haskell Web Framework](https://github.com/TerranceN/Haskell-Web-Framework) that I built, which will be install automatically when building.

If you wish to build my website you need ghc and make. Once you have cloned this repository, just run make and it should build fine.
